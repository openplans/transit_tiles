# OpenPlans Transit Tiles
We want to make beautiful map tiles of transit systems available for developers. We're doing this by making available each of the pieces we use to generate our own transit map tiles. We're just getting started so any feedback is appreciated!

# The Pieces
* Spatial data for transit routes and stops (see [supported formats](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/adding-layers/))
* Style assets, including [Carto](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/wiki) stylesheets and images
* [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) to generate the tile images

# Cities
These are the cities for which transit tiles have been created. Each section should have the following links:

* Spatial data
* Assets
* MBTiles, rendered tiles that can be served via [MapBox.com](http://mapbox.com/) or your own version of [TileStream](https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream)
* Other references
